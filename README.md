# teemo_doing_things
 _Teemo helps you doing stuff_

This project is made by me for me, if you find it useful it's nice. The main goal is to make a command line assistant to help you doing basic actions.

Teemo doing things is mainly aimed for Linux based OS, but it might have Windows and MacOS support if I like it. But it will be developed with the support os the 3 OS in mind. Feel free to complete it.

## Teemo will help you

It's simple, every time I want to understand a thing in particular in Linux or cybersec I will add the functionality to teemo. Think of it as a middleware. It will be coded in Python for now. Teemo is dev in Python <`3.10.1`. If you want to dev on it I recommend you take a look at `pipenv` module for the dependencies.

## 1 rst part of the journey is package installations
_Teemo knows how to grow shrooms and how to grow one on your pc. He can't grow a species that he doesn't have in his inventory._

You can consult Teemo inventory with the command `teemo shrooms -a`.

`teemo shrooms -h` will display inventory help.
